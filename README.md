# PongGame

Pong is the old, classic, two-player, 2D tennis game.

## Why?
Going into my last few semesters at the University of West Florida studying computer engineering, I figured it was about time I start making some side projects that help me figure out how I work and what works for me. I know I should have done this long ago, but **late is better than never**.
Also, I have been practicing using SDL for just a few weeks (primarily following [Lazy Foo' Productions](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) tutorials). I have strayed from them a bit, figuring out how to move textures on the screen using keys and checking for intersections (2 very important things that happen in pong). I am excited for all the new things this project and my future projects will teach me!

## Planning

- [ ] Create the start screen that begins the game once the user presses the start key.
- [ ] Create the background with the *net* in the middle.
- [ ] Create the scoreboard that updates automatically and ends the game once a player has reached 7 points.
- [ ] Create the two *paddles* that each player controls (WASD for the left player and arrow keys for the right player).
- [ ] Create the ball that moves across the screen and either intersects with the top screen boarders and bounces, the players' paddles and bounces, or the players' *goals* and updates the scoreboard and resets to the center.

## Goals

I hope to complete this before school starts next week, but with work, girlfriend, the gym, and online video games all serving as big time distractions. I do not know if I will be able to complete this goal. It is currently Tuesday 1/3/2023, and school begins on 1/9/2023, so we'll have to see. 
I also hope I learn a lot even though it is a simple project (right now I am learning how to properly use markdown :joy:).
