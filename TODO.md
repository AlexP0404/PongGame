### TODO: UPGRADE THIS GAME WITH NEWLY ACQUIRED SKILLS 

 # Implement the timer class in the game loop so the game runs the same on all computers
 # Create an "Entity" class that is a parent to the dot and paddle classes in order to remove a lot of repeat code

 # MAYBE add online multiplayer (this is a bit of a stretch)
